Bored and feel like watching a movie, but you don't know what to watch? Simply select a genre and let FilmFinder do all the work!

This site makes use of SASS/SCSS rather than CSS and also uses the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) library of SASS mixins. Make sure to place the Bourbon folder in the stylesheets folder.

In order to run this code yourself you will also need to sign up for an account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) and get an [API key](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/). Place the API key at the top of [main.js](https://github.com/jcordeiro/FilmFinder/blob/master/scripts/main.js) and you're good to go.
