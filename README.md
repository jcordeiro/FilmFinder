Bored and feel like watching a movie, but you don't know what to watch? Simply select a genre and let FilmFinder do all the work!

I used SASS/SCSS to produce the stylesheet and made use of the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) library of SASS mixins. I've placed the CSS folder in the git repository to make it easier to run the code yourself, so there are no dependancies on Bourbon or SASS/SCSS.

To run this code yourself you will also need to sign up for an account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) and get an [API key](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/). Place the API key at the top of [main.js](https://github.com/jcordeiro/FilmFinder/blob/master/scripts/main.js) and you're good to go.
